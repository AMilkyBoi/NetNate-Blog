      <h4><b>The Early Years</b></h4>
      <h6>Date: <span class="w3-opacity">2017 - 2019</span></h6>
      <p>This website started out when I was in my junior year of high school. One
         of the requirements for my junior IB English class was to create a
         project that was instructive and promoted discussion. My team and I
         decided to create a podcast where we talked about our experiences in the
         IB program. In order to make a platform to host member information as
         well as the episodes themselves, I decided to create a website. The
         netnate domain was purchased in August of 2017, and I started to work
         on the page soon after. I worked on this version of the website up
         until my graduation in 2019. After high school was over, I wanted to
         evolve the website into something that was more focused and individual.
         The original code for this iteration of the
         webpage is still viewable at
         <a href="https://github.com/AMilkyBoi/ezz345.github.io">
           my GitHub page</a>.

      <h4><b>Personalization</b></h4>
      <h6>Date: <span class="w3-opacity">2019 - 2021</span></h6>
      <p>After changing the focus of the website, my main goal was to discover
        interesting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript methods. At the time, I was
        becoming more invested in the idea of using the website as a
        LinkedIn-esque page; however, I didn't spend much time refining the look
        of the page after a few large initial commits. After creating the page,
        I became focused on other things and didn't work on the website much
        until I decided that I wanted to restyle it for the second time. I also
        saved the code for this version of the webpage
        <a href="https://github.com/AMilkyBoi/netnate-legacy">here</a>.</p>

      <h4><b>Current Iteration</b></h4>
      <h6>Date: <span class="w3-opacity">2021 - Present</span></h6>
      <p>The last major change that was done to the website was started in 2021.
         The thing that I was focusing on changing during this iteration was
         changing the purpose of the website. Previously, I was using the
         website as a way to hone my webdev skills; now, I wanted to focus on
         making the website a functional site that I would be proud of
         designing. I plan on keeping the current form of the website up
         indefinantly, making changes and updates as they come. Check out the
         repo for the current form of the site at my
         <a href="https://github.com/AMilkyBoi/NetNate">NetNate page</a>.</p>
